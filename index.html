		Food for Thoth is an online platform that takes you back to the lost art of passing on books once
you’ve read them. Sharing and exchanging books has now become a thing of the past. For our
book lovers, we aim to bring back the feel of reading a used book, holding it in your hands and
reading the same story through your eyes that several before you have read.</span><br><br>
	<span class="doc-heading">The Name Explained</span><br>
		<span class="doc-content">
		Thoth is the Egyptian god of Wisdom. Food for Thoth, as the name suggests, is FFT trying to bring back lost wisdom through the old practice of sharing it. Share your knowledge, someone
learns while you earn!</span><br><br>
<span class="doc-heading">How it Works</span><br>
		<span class="doc-content">
		When you sign up, you will first be asked to choose genres that you would like to read. Based on
your preferences, books will show up on your recommended feed. Should you choose to borrow
a book, all you have to do is swipe right on it, to send a message to the lender to let them know
you’re interested. You will then be asked to pick a lending period, the pricing of which is
explained in the Pricing Model ahead. Based on what you choose, you pay the amount online and
confirm your rental. An FFT executive will then be assigned to deliver the book from the
lender’s address to you, the borrower.</span><br><br>
<span class="doc-heading">How it Works</span><br>
		<span class="doc-content">
		You can also make some easy money from the comfort of your home by becoming a lender on
FFT. All you have to do is take a picture of the book you want to lend and upload it under the
correct genre along with the author’s name. Your book will show up on the recommended feed
of someone who is interested in the genre. Should they choose to swipe right, they will be asked
to choose a borrowing period. According to the plan they pick, they will be making an instant
online transfer to FFT. We get a small commission, while you receive the payment instantly,
following which, an FFT executive picks up the book and drops it back to your place when the
lending period is at an end.</span><br>
